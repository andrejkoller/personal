                  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. My days
                  are largely filled with planning and programming, where I
                  focus on web development and data management. I&apos;m always
                  eager to expand my knowledge, explore new technologies, and
                  refine my skills. If you&apos;re interested in the specific
                  tools and programming languages I work with, feel free to
                  check out my GitHub profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you&apos;re curious about my projects, I encourage you to
                  explore my GitHub for both current and future uploads.
                  You&apos;ll find all relevant links at the end of each page.

                  Beyond programming, music plays a vital role in my life.
                  Playing classical piano and organ allows me to immerse myself
                  in different musical worlds, shaped by composers such as
                  Satie, Schumann, Mozart, and Chopin. I have a deep passion for
                  forgotten and lesser-known organ music, both historical and
                  contemporary, and enjoy uncovering lost works to bring them
                  back to life. Through my YouTube channel, I share a unique
                  collection of organ and piano recordings, showcasing the
                  beauty of these instruments across various styles. If
                  you&apos;re interested in collaborating on musical projects,
                  feel free to reach out—I&apos;m always open to new
                  connections.
